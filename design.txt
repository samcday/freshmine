So on every sync we do the following:

* projects.list with Sauce client_id. Regex out "Redmine ID: (\d+)" to determine
  corresponding Redmine project identifier. Build a lookup dict for this.
* Iterate over all time entries in Redmine since given date.
* For each entry:
    - Find the corresponding freshbooks project id for the project this redmine
      time entry belongs to.
        > If the project doesn't yet exist in Freshbooks, create it and add it
          to the project lookup dict.
    - If we haven't already, do a time_entry.list on the Freshbooks project.
      Regex out "Redmine ID: (\d+)" and build lookup table.
    - If this time entry hasn't yet been synced to Freshbooks, sync it with
      time_entry.create
